Finals Drill

Frameworks and libraries

o Next.js - Minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications.
o Typescript - Superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes
and interfaces.
o SWR- React hooks library for data fetching.
o Material-UI - Popular React UI framework.
o Formik - is the world's most popular open source form library for React and React Native.
o Yup - is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
o Axios - is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser.

Objective:
Students will learn to build a profile page using modern web development technologies, focusing on
server-rendered React applications with Next.js, TypeScript for static typing, SWR for data fetching,
Material-UI for UI components, Formik for form handling, Yup for form validation, and Axios for HTTP
requests.

Requirements:
Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Familiarity with React concepts.
Node.js and npm installed on their machines.
Instructions:

1. Setup Project:
• Set up a new Next.js project using TypeScript.
• Install necessary dependencies: SWR, Material-UI, Formik, Yup, and Axios.
• Set up a basic project structure with Next.js pages and components.
2. Design Profile Page:
• Design a profile page layout using Material-UI components.
• Include form fields for user information like name, email, bio, etc.
3. Implement Form Handling:
• Use Formik to handle form state and validation.
• Define validation schema using Yup for form fields.

4. Integrate Data Fetching:
• Utilize SWR to fetch user data from a mock API or a backend server.
• Display user information fetched from the API in the profile form.
5. Add CRUD Functionality:
• Implement Axios to enable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
• Enable users to update their profile information and save it to the server.
6. Enhance User Experience:
• Implement error handling for form submissions and API requests.
• Add loading indicators during data fetching and form submissions.
7. Test and Debug:
• Test the profile page thoroughly, including form validation and data fetching.
• Debug any issues that arise during testing.
8. Deploy the Application:
• Deploy the profile page application to a hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.
